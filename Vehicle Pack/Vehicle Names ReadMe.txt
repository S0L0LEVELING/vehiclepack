Open veh_names and replace "SPAWN NAME" with the spawn code of the
vehicle you want to add, it may look something like rmodbmw320 for
example.

Replace "NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE" with the vehicle description.

Do not remove the " ". 

Example:

    AddTextEntry("newsvan", "BBC News Van")


You can add more categories and keep the names in the veh_names.lua file neat and tidy if you wish, for example:

Sports Cars
Super Cars
Off-Road Cars
Police Cars
Trains
Military Vehicles

etc etc.


Backup in case you 'accidentally' deleted it:

    AddTextEntry("SPAWN NAME", "NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE")
